### Hi, This is Julian ðŸ‘‹

I'm detail-oriented fullstack developer with 8+ years of expertise working on web application development and blockchain systems.
I am looking for a way to further develop my skills in this area and looking for an organization that will give me a brand new challenge in a fast paced environment.
